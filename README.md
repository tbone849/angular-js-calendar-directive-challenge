## Description
This is a calendar app I built as an assignment through [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com). My portion of the assignemnt included creating a calendar directive. The calendar will display the current month and highlight the current day in orange. The user can change the month and year (+20 or -20 form the current year).
